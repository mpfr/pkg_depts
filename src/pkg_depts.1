.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_depts
.Nd figure out reverse package dependencies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl t
.Op Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
determines package dependents, i.e. which packages directly or indirectly
depend on the package(s) in question.
The result will be printed to
.Ar stdout .
First, direct dependencies are determined by evaluating the
.Dv @depend
annotation returned by the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command
.Pp
.Dl pkg_info -f
.Pp
for all packages installed on the system.
After that, indirect dependencies are discovered by recursively walking
previously gathered infomation until trapped in a loop or no further
dependency exists.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "pkg-name"
.It Fl t
Enables output of dependency trees.
.It Ar pkg-name
The name of a package to query either with or without trailing version number.
If given, the version must start with a number and
.Ar pkg-name
must be connected to that number by a single dash character, as in
.Dv php-7 ,
for example.
.Nm
matches version numbers of any kind and size.
Generally, fewer parts given will result in more packages being found.
For example,
.Dv php-7
will match all
.Dv PHP 7
versions, while
.Dv php-7.4
will filter for
.Dv PHP 7.4
only.
.El
.Pp
If called without parameters,
.Nm
will just walk through all installed packages and determine their direct
dependencies.
As this information is required at every dependency inquiry and remains the
same as long as installed packages on the system do not change, it is usually
being redirected into a cache file so it may be reused as input to
.Ar stdin
later.
.Sh USAGE
As stated above, in order to avoid the discovery of direct dependencies for
every new inquiry, it is recommended to first let
.Nm
build a dependency cache and save the result into a file (here
.Ar pkg_depts.cache Ns ):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pkg_depts > pkg_depts.cache
ImageMagick-6.9.10.86p0 ... ok
argon2-20171227 ... ok
bzip2-1.0.8 ... ok
cairo-1.16.0 ... ok
curl-7.69.1p1 ... ok
djvulibre-3.5.27p6 ... ok
fcgi-2.4.0p18 ... ok
femail-1.0p1 ... ok
femail-chroot-1.0p3 ... ok
 .
 .
 .
vmm-firmware-1.11.0p2 ... ok
wget-1.20.3p3 ... ok
xz-5.2.5 ... ok
#
.Ed
.Pp
Now, we're ready to start our first inquiry (here for the
.Ar glib2
package) which will return a plain list of all dependent packages.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pkg_depts glib2 < pkg_depts.cache
ImageMagick-6.9.10.86p0
cairo-1.16.0
djvulibre-3.5.27p6
gdk-pixbuf-2.40.0p2
gtk-update-icon-cache-3.24.20
harfbuzz-2.6.5
munin-server-2.0.59
pango-1.44.7p0
pecl74-imagick-3.4.4p0
rrdtool-1.7.2
rrdupdate-1.7.2
shared-mime-info-1.15
#
.Ed
.Pp
In case we're interested in the complete dependency tree, we just add the
.Fl t
option:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
